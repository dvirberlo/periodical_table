# Periodical Table
C# windows forms application, i did as school project.

## Some insights
First, I want to mention that I did not really chose anything about this project:
- the subject- I chose between a short list of project from my teacher
- the technologies- I had to use C# WFA and MS Access
- the structure, features and the way of doing things- I was mostly specifically instructed about those things by my teacher

Now, do not get me wrong, I do appreciate my teacher and his work. It is just that professionally- I do not agree with him...

I found WFA very unmodern and uneffective compared to other technologies I used in the past.
- An example for this is that I had to build from scratch a (not so inteligent) drawing system to spread UI elements evenly as a table (the Periodical Table)- something I knew can be easily done with, say, few lines of CSS.

(Now maybe there is a way to do it natively with some element from the WFA elements, but I didn't dig in to find out)

And since I received the tasks for the project in small pieces, one after another, I could not guess what was the scale of the project and what components and features should be seperated for reuse across the codebase.

Nevertheless, I couldn't say I learned nothing from this project.
- I did had some more experience with ( YESSQL ;) ) SQL DB
- I did had some more experience with C#

But this is the point, I think, just more experience, with nothing notably new.
I couldn't even use the latest version of C# to enjoy a reasonable language, since I think WFA doesn't support it.

Anyway, I finished it and I got 100 points, so it was worth the effort.
